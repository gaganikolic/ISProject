# Information Systems â€“ Distributed Microservices Project

This project was developed as part of the *Information Systems* course and demonstrates a distributed system based on a **microservices-inspired architecture**. The system is composed of:

- A **central server** (Web Application)
- Multiple **subsystems** (Enterprise Application Clients)
- A **client application** communicating with the central server via REST

The project illustrates key principles of enterprise systems, including **asynchronous communication (JMS)**, **database access via JPA**, and **RESTful APIs**.
